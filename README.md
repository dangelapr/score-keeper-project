This is a simple score keeper. I used only HTML and JS, although in hindsight I wish I would have included a dedicated stylesheet but that's ok. 
I'm very proud of this project as it is my first time creating something that doesn't look as basic as it is, and also because I was able to get even more familiar with JS and all its powers.
Event listeners are so cool!
I would love to implement this feature in a more complex game, maybe a volleyball simulator!
